# DFX WinTweaks IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED ‚ùå

### üôè If you find an issue, PLEASE report it.

DFX WinTweaks helps you to tweak your Windows install beyond what Microsoft typically allows you to. It's currently in development, so new features will be added over time. (bugfixes and qol upgrades will be made as well)

**WARNING: I'm not responsible for any issues that might happen on your system. The changes made by DFX WinTweaks are generally minor registry tweaks or service disabling, but use it with caution.**

**Also, DFX WinTweaks will ALWAYS recommend you to make a Recovery Point every time you start it.**

**If your security software/browser flags DFX WinTweaks as harmful, you can make an exception for it and try to run it again. This might be due to an option that can interfere with Microsoft Defender while it is running. Disabling Microsoft Defender might require you to restart your computer in Safe Mode.**

## üêá Online features
DFX WinTweaks doesn't need an internet connection to work at all, except for some browser options like reporting issues on GitHub or visiting the website.

**From version 3.5 onwards (Released on Actober 16, 2023), an internet connection will only be required to find updates.**

## üíª System Requirements
DFX WinTweaks works on Windows 10 and later. Windows 8.1, 8, 7 (including server variants) are no longer supported.

**If you use Windows 7 or Windows 8.x, use the older version available on the website.**

## üí± Modified Versions
You can modify the tool to make it work on older Windows versions, but there's no guarantee that everything will work as intended.

## ‚ùå Known Issues (Based on latest public release)
Keep in mind that DFX WinTweaks might have occasional bugs and problems, you can treat it as beta software, because it mostly is, i'm currently working to fix everything that is listed up here.
- Presets don't work as intended and have been removed while I work on these.

## üßÄ Why DFX WinTweaks?
I created DFX WinTweaks because I needed a way to disable Windows Update and Defender. I found AikonCWD W10 Script, a similar tool with more features, but it required an internet connection for most of them. I wanted something similar but functional offline. That's why I started this project, and I want to give credit to AikonCWD and their script.

If you want the AikonCWD Script, you can find it by scrolling down.

## üß≠ AikonCWD W10 Script
All releases up to version 1.11.2 ESR were "fully" based on AikonCWD W10 Script. You can download it [**here**](https://github.com/aikoncwd/win10script) - **(In Spanish)**
If you like DFX WinTweaks, credit goes to [**AikonCWD**](https://github.com/aikoncwd) for creating the script that started everything.

## ‚õ≤ Source Code
While DFX WinTweaks is Open Source, it kind of doesn't have any source code, because you can easily download any release and modify/fork it using a text editor. Just remember to follow the GPL 3.0 license.
